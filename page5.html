        The "Neighbourhood" refers to an alternative rock and dark pop band formed in Newbury Park, California, in 2011 by vocalist Jesse Rutherford, guitarists Jeremy Freedman and Zach Abels, and bassist Mikey Margott. After a mysterious online launch, the band gained popularity with their EP I'm Sorry... and the single "Sweater Weather" in 2013, followed by the album I Love You.. Known for their black-and-white aesthetics and evolving sound, the band has continued to release music, including the album I Love You and subsequent EPs and albums, while maintaining a focus on dark, suburban themes.

        I chose this band because I love playing their songs during trips or outings. Their music feels relaxing and the lyrics are deeply meaningful to me. They truly deserve to be listened to and to release more music, because their artistry is worth sharing with the world.
