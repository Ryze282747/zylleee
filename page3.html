        Oasis was a hugely successful English Britpop band formed in Manchester in 1991, best known for their rivalry between the Gallagher brothers, Liam and Noel, who were the band's lead singer and main songwriter, respectively. The group's early lineup included Liam Gallagher (vocals), Paul "Bonehead" Arthurs (guitar), Paul "Guigsy" McGuigan (bass), and Tony McCarroll (drums), with Noel Gallagher joining later as lead guitarist and songwriter. They achieved massive success with albums like Definitely Maybe and (What's the Story) Morning Glory?, and played a historic concert at Knebworth in 1996 before officially disbanding in 2009 after years of internal conflict

        I chose this band because they’re one of my dad’s and my favorites. I’ve always had a love for old songs, especially their track Wonderwall. It’s not just about the song itself—it carries such a strong nostalgic feeling every time I listen to them. I know that at my age, it’s rare to still appreciate their music, and that makes my connection to the band even more meaningful.
