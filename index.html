        Cigarettes After Sex is an American dream pop band formed in El Paso, Texas, in 2008 by Greg Gonzalez, their consistent songwriter and vocalist. Known for their ethereal, dream-like sound and romantic, introspective lyrics, the band gained global popularity through music recommendations, notably the sleeper hit "Nothing's Gonna Hurt You Baby" in 2016. After releasing their debut EP, I., in 2012, their debut album Cigarettes After Sex followed in 2017, with subsequent albums Cry (2019) and X's(2024).

        I chose Cigarettes After Sex because I truly feel their vibe and lyrics. I love CAS, and I deeply relate to their songs—not because they became popular, but because, as a listener and fan, the lyrics they deliver hold real meaning for me.
